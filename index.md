# Grant's User Page

Hello! My name is Grant Cheng. I am a second year student at the University of California, San Diego pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. My interests as a programmer lie in *software engineering* and *artificial intelligence* (more specifically deep learning).

Here is a table of contents of my page!

## My Works

I have a variety of different projects that I have done as a programmer within the past few years. Here are some of the following!

### Personal Website

This is a website that I made about myself built entirely using the Astro framework. I wanted to learn Astro since one of the Youtubers that I watch (Fireship.io) mentioned it, and I thought it would be pretty cool to learn how to code a simple website with Astro. You can find my website [here](https://www.grantcheng.com).

### KachowRL

`KachowRL` is an experimental project that I did under a club (ACM at UCSD) that aimed to learn about reinforcement learning using a car as it races on a track. We tested various reinforcement learning algorithms where the input would be a screenshot of the entire screen and the output would be how the car would move next. You can find a link to the GitHub project [here](https://github.com/acmucsd-projects/KachowRL).

### SnAIke

`SnAIke` is a summer project that aimed to use a feed forward neural network to test learn how to use the genetic algorithm and how it works with the classic arcade game snake. We (my partner and I) learned a lot about some of the higher level difficulties of learning with neural networks, such as determining the size and number of hidden layers and deciding on what the input to the model should be. A link to the project can be found [here](https://github.com/UCSD-CSE-SPIS-2021/spis21-snaike-Arnav-Grant).

## My Hobbies

I also have some other hobbies including, but not limited to:
1. Cooking
2. Rock Climbing
3. Cycling

Here are some images that represent my hobbies!

## Future Goals

Here are some of my future goals, programming-related or otherwise:
- [ ] Study abroad in Japan
- [ ] Send a bouldering route with a rating of V5 and above
- [ ] From start to finish design and develop my own deep learning project

While we're at it, here's a cheesy quote abou the future to get me inspired to achieve these goals! As Abraham Lincoln apparently puts it,
> You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.

Which (I think) accurately portrays my mindsets for these future goals. Because while they are **future** goals, they are goals that I am actively purusing **right now**.
